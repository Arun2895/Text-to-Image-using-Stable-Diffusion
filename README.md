TEXT TO IMAGE USING STABLE DIFFUSION

This repository is dedicated to showcase my work at Muonium AI. This repository contains a Python implementation of a Text to Image Generator using the Stable Diffusion model. Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model that generates photorealistic images from textual descriptions. This project leverages the power of the Stable Diffusion model to enable users to generate images simply by providing descriptive text prompts.

FEATURES

Text to Image Generation: Convert textual descriptions into high-quality images.
Customizable Prompts: Users can input their own text prompts to generate unique images.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, which has been fine-tuned on a large dataset for optimal performance.
Easy to Use: Simple command-line interface for generating images.

DISCLAIMER

This project requires a CUDA-compatible GPU to run efficiently. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia. It allows software to use the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, and is essential for running the Stable Diffusion model in a reasonable timeframe. Without a CUDA-compatible GPU, the performance will be significantly degraded, and the processing time may be impractically long.
